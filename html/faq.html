                  The framers of the Constitution took note of the fact that certain communities in the country were
                  suffering from extreme social, educational and economic backwardness on account of the primitive agricultural
                  practices, lack of infrastructure facilities and geographical isolation. The Constitution of India in Article 366 (25)
                  prescribe that the Scheduled Tribes means such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 of the
                  Constitution to be Scheduled Tribes.
