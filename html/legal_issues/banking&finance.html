            <h3>Is Trading in Cryptocurrency Legal in India?</h3>
            <p>Technological advancement around the globe has paved the way for making the world digital. With the
                growing popularity of internet technologies, another advancement has come to light in recent years known
                as virtual currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, due to its growing popularity,
                has become one of the most common forms of internet currency being used by millions of internet users
                for various digital transactions from booking hotels and flights to purchasing jewelry and computer
                parts. Since Cryptocurrency is not regulated by any central authority, trading in an unregulated sector
                can lead to money laundering, fraud, and even funding terrorism. In this law guide, we are going to
                cover all that you need to know about trading in cryptocurrencies and the law governing it in India.</p>

            <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency refers to a digital or virtual currency that works as a medium of exchange and uses
                cryptography to secure and verify the transactions along with to control the creation of new units of a
                particular cryptocurrency. In other words, cryptocurrency is limited entries in a database that cannot
                be altered unless certain conditions are fulfilled.</p>

            <h3>Laws Governing Cryptocurrency in India</h3>
            <p>As stated above, cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in India, and while exchanges are legal, the
                government has made it very difficult for them to operate. Although, there is a lack of clarity on the
                tax status of the cryptocurrency, the chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes has stated that
                anyone making profits from Bitcoin will have to pay taxes on the same. It has also been suggested by the
                Income Tax department that the profits from cryptocurrencies should be taxed as capital gains.</p>
            <p>Since there is no specific law governing cryptocurrencies, the government of India is looking at the
                possibility of cryptocurrency regulation. The special secretary of economic affairs in 2017 had formed a
                committee to suggest ways to tackle issues related to cryptocurrencies which was also working on a draft
                bill regulating cryptocurrencies. According to the draft Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of
                Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, holding, selling, or dealing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
                can land you in jail for 10 years. Besides making it completely illegal, the bill makes holding of
                cryptocurrencies a non-bailable offense. However, the fate of the bill is yet unknown.</p>
            <p>Many other countries have regularized cryptocurrency in their respective jurisdiction. For instance, Canada does not treat virtual currency as a valid legal tender but allows the trade of these currencies in the country
            by making a few amendments to Canada's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. This not only
            allows virtual currencies by legalizing as a money service business for protection from money laundering. However, many
            countries are recognizing and legalizing this activity and are successfully able to tax the traders under various laws.
            For example, Israel taxes it as an asset, while the United Kingdom taxes it under various branches like Corporation pay
            or Corporate Tax while individuals pay capital gain tax.</p>
            <p>The above instances from various countries show that there are many ways to regulate this business activity which
                could be a success, though admittedly, there are many challenges ahead in regulating this business activity. From
                India's perspective, a major point for consideration is that introduction of a Digital rupee as a legal tender may
                be a point of conflict as, by way of banning other virtual currencies and introducing the Digital Rupee, the
                government may have a monopoly in this business. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has noted this aspect while
                discussing this issue but evaded discussion on it by stating that such a situation has not yet arisen as enactment
                is still in bill shape.</p>
            <p>Connect with an expert lawyer for your legal issue</p>
            <h3>How can a lawyer help you?</h3>
            <p>Since the concept of cryptocurrency is new in India and there are no regulations regulating the same yet, a banking
                and finance lawyer must be consulted before getting involved in any transactions related to the same as any
                operation involving cryptocurrency requires vigilance and legal knowledge without which the person involved can face
                serious losses or in the worst-case scenario, legal charges.</p>
